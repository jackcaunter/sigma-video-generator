decided not to automate the LLM phase just yet. better to manually select the text that goes forward for more processing, at
this stage in development.

hooked up the elevenlabs api, and got it working – returning audio and timestamps.

tried to use Pedalboard by spotify to mixdown audio, ended up being way easier with PyDub.
considering using Pedalboard for audio effects in the future.
