started video generation. blender can now output a .mp4 file of a square.


next up:
use the timings in the metadata .json file in input/generated_tts to generate transparent text captions in blender.

overlay these onto a background video (with a subway surfer on the bottom for good measure)
and add the audio in blender too.

need background video files. at least 1.
